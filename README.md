# Repository for React projects

 ## About
This repository contains small to medium-sized React projects where I explore React alongside various tools and technologies. For the backend, I use tools like Express.js and Node.js, while for the frontend, I experiment with CSS, Tailwind, and more.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend:
- React: For building user interfaces and managing component-based architecture.
- Vanilla CSS: For styling components and ensuring responsive design.
- Vite: A modern build tool and development server for blazing-fast development experience.
### Backend:
- Node.js: As the runtime environment for building scalable server-side applications.
- Express.js: For creating RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic.
